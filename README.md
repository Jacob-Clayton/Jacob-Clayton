## Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working on my [Ethereum Analytics Tool](https://github.com/Jacob-Clayton/Etherscan-API), a back-end python script to analyse ETH addresses.

- And I'm always tinkering with the front-end animations and design of my [Portfolio](http://jacobclayton.dev).
